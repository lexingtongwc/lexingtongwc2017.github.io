  <h1>Why is coding important for the future?</h1>
  <p>By 2020, 1.4 million computer science jobs will be available. Currently only 18% of science graduates are women, compared to the 37% in 1984.  As the gender gap increases, the importance of young girls to be interested in Computer Programming to get ready for their future careers becomes more significant. If more girls are taught to code, they will have more job opportunities in the future, which will lead to a more successful life.
