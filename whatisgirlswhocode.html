    What is Girls Who Code?
  </h1>
  
  
  
  <p>
  Girls Who Code is a national nonprofit organization dedicated towards bridging the gender gap of women in the STEM field. 
  At girls who code, the teachers encourage us to learn code and it makes us really familiar with the basis of coding.
  When you go to Girls Who Code, you are a girl just like every other person there so you are in a friendly environment with
    people you should be comfortable with.
    </p>

  While coding, the teachers like to walk around to get the feeling of what you can do so they can give you the work that you
  should feel comfortable with so you can work calmly.

  A lot of girls join, country wide, so there is a larger variety of races and grades 6th-12th. 
  The girls at girls who code learn also how to use computers and make games. In addition, at the end of the year we make try
  to make an impact project to encourage other peers to join Girls Who Code.

    Itâ€™s important for females to contribute to the technology industry. 63% of the girls who code community are considering the major 
    or minor in Computer science in college. Anyone can make a difference in the world, and Girls Who Code is allowing more
    to do it - one girl at a time.

    There are lots of women in the world that changed us, however, there is an infinity of potential for the next generations
  to come (go to WWC to get more information).
