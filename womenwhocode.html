  <h1>Women Who Code and Why You Should Code</h1>
  <h3 id="dark">Why is coding important for the future?</h3>
  <p>By 2020, 1.4 million computer science jobs will be available. Currently only 18% of science graduates are women, compared to the 37% in 1984.  As the gender gap increases, the importance of young girls being interested in Computer Science is becoming more significant. This will make for a better and wider variety of job oppurtunities. If more girls are taught to code, they will have more job opportunities in the future, which will lead to a more successful life. In addition, coding inspires creativity and ideas to unfold, especially with females now becoming a part of the computer science. People have come up with several creative ideas which they are implementing with code.</p>
